- [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) — took me over a week of evening reading, but it was definitely worth it. Just enjoyed brushing up on the concepts and honestly was impressed by the level of detail even a minor interface element can have. It’s no doubt the Bible for every iOS developer.
- [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) — a must-read for every developer who is about to submit their app to the App Store. I just reviewed it today and liked the clear language that Apple uses here.
- [User privacy and data use](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) and [App privacy details](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) - a great explanation of how to handle private data, what tracking is, and how to clearly state what data the app uses and how it is used.
